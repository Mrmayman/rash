This directory contains a bunch of tests for the interpreter.

Note: Currently the interpreter cannot load SB3 files, this was for the old version which could load them. Anyway keeping this here as I may add SB3 loading in the future.

# Made by me

- `mc1.sb3` is a basic tile-based scrolling minecraft 2d demo.

- `mc23pre66.sb3` is the same project, after 2 years of development. It is a 2d Minecraft clone with complexity close to Paper Minecraft.

- `pi calculator.sb3` is a benchmark for calculating pi.

- `repeated sum.sb3` is for checking the performance of repeated addition.

- `vartest.sb3` and `block test` - The purpose of these change frequently. Used to test blocks.

# Made by someone else

- `Pong 1 Sprite 1 Script.sb3` - https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/16088555.

- `1s1s1cportableplatformerscroller.sb3` - https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1414675/ (by freejam).

- `operator_test.sb3` - I don't know who made this, but @adazem009 sent it to me. It is the basis of some of the math tests (`cargo test`).
